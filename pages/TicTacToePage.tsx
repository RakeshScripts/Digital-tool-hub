        <p>Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.</p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary dark:text-gray-100 mt-6 mb-2">How to Play</h3>
        <p>The rules are simple, making it a perfect game for all ages:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5">
            <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
            <li>You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</li>
            <li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
            <li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary dark:text-gray-100 mt-6 mb-2">Basic Strategy</h3>
        <p>While luck plays a part, there's also strategy involved. A player can play a perfect game of Tic-Tac-Toe (to win or at least draw) if they choose the move that will maximize their chances of winning. Here are a few tips:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
            <li><strong>Win:</strong> If you have two of your marks in a row, place the third to get three in a row.</li>
            <li><strong>Block:</strong> If the opponent has two in a row, play the third one yourself to block the opponent.</li>
            <li><strong>Fork:</strong> Create an opportunity where you have two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of two).</li>
            <li><strong>Block Fork:</strong> If the opponent can create a fork, you must block it. This may involve creating a two-in-a-row to force the opponent into defending, as long as it doesn't result in them creating a fork.</li>
            <li><strong>Center:</strong> A player who plays the center square on their first move has a higher chance of winning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enjoy this digital version of the timeless game. Challenge a friend and see who comes out on top!</p>
